Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Stefan, a PhD student working on autonomous driving at Mercedes-Benz.
I'm also part of the [Autonomous Vision Group at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/autonomous-vision/team/), supervised by Andreas Geiger.

My research is at the intersection of machine learning and 3D Vision, especially motion-based self-supervised learning based for 3D LiDAR sensors.
