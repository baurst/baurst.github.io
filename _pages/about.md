Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Stefan, a ML Engineer working on autonomous driving at Mercedes-Benz.

I have obtained my PhD as part of the [Autonomous Vision Group at the University of TÃ¼bingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/autonomous-vision/team/), supervised by [Andreas Geiger](https://cvlibs.net/). You can find my thesis [here](https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/handle/10900/166495).

My research is at the intersection of machine learning and 3D Vision, especially motion-based self-supervised learning for 3D LiDAR sensors.

I strongly believe in the [Bitter Lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html): In the long run, methods that can make better use of data and compute tend to outperform all the clever tricks we come up with as computer vision researchers.
That said, I think motion-based self-supervised learning in 3D is a practical shortcut for models to obtain a deeper world understanding: It scales with data and compute, while taking advantage of how things actually move and exist in 3D space.
